							<p> This is why there's the funky rockers, instead of 2 powerful actuators, the forces cancel out. ALSO, because of the position of the rear pivot, the net force
							changes sign halfway through the stroke, like a toggle. The wings push back, it's stable in both positions!</p>

							<p> Car2D is our homegrown simulator. This method is called the Milliken moment method, it sums up the torques on the tires. Solutions where the sum is 0 mean the car is in a steady-state turn, skidpad. 
							These sims are compared against track data later</p>

							<p>Alas, our battery pack isn't huge and the extra drag would mean we can't drive all out during the endurance event. Using previous lap data and making some assumptions on when DRS is used,
							it's calculated that DRS saves a lap's worth of energy in a 15.77 lap race (which could be the difference between finishing or not)</p>

							<p> This project is about making a motor dynomometer test bench. This has been a long term goal of the team because it gives us a powerful 
platform to test our car's powertrain with hardware in the loop (HIL). The DynoDAQ board is able to control both the speed of the dyno and the torque output of the test article, 
meaning we can run detailed, repeatable test cycles. It has already proven useful in power output maximization and PID tuning. Planned tests include:  Driving style efficiency testing, and powertrain validation testing.</p>
